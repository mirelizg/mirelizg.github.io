        Hello, my name is Mireliz Gimenez, I am in my third semester at Wake Tech. In my free time, 
        I like to read books, do some photography, and watch “old” TV shows, like Friends, 
        Criminal Minds, Grey's Anatomy, and more. I am from Venezuela, I lived there for 15 years 
        of my life and then I came here, I lived first in Miami and then I moved to Raleigh, NC. 
        I like collecting stuff that has any meaning to me and storing it in boxes to keep 
        the memory. I love to travel, I am always trying to fly anywhere I can.
